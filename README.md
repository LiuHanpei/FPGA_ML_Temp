# FPGA_ML_Temp

## Description
This repository contains Python and C++ implementations of fundamental deep learning operations, including:

路Batch Normalization

路Activation Functions (ReLU, Tanh)

路Fully Connected (Linear) Layers

路Standard & Depthwise Convolutions

Each operation is implemented in Python (for generating test data and reference results) and in C++ (for efficient computation, designed for FPGA deployment with HLS optimizations).



## Environment Setup

Python: 3.12.8

C++ Compiler: Apple clang version 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.6)

Xilinx Toolchain: Vivado 2022.1, Vitis HLS 2022.1

## Implementation on HLS
